name: TransferDrink
description: Bring the mug (drink) to the user's mouth for a sip. Before initiating
  the transfer sequence for drink, the robot can confirm with the user on the web
  app (web interface) once using AskForConfirmationInitiatingTransferSequence. A drink
  transfer starts with an ReadyToInitiateTransferInteraction (robot to human) where
  the robot conveys to the user that it is ready to initiate the drink transfer, then
  an InitiateTransferInteraction (human to robot) where the human conveys to the robot
  that it is ready for a drink transfer. After this, the robot moves the mug either
  near the user's mouth (OutsideMouthDistance defines how near) or inside the user's
  mouth. Then commences the ReadyForTransferInteraction (robot to human) where the
  robot conveys to the user that they can take a sip now. After the users is done
  taking a sip, they use the TransferCompleteInteraction (human to robot) to convey
  to the robot that they are done. The robot then moves the mug away from the user's
  mouth. Once a drink transfer is complete, the robot waits for TimeToWaitBeforeAutocontinue
  on the web app (web interface) before re-selecting drink transfer again.
